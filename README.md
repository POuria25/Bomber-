This program is a 2D airplane simulation game developed using Python and Pygame. The main functionalities include manual and automatic bomb dropping, visual rendering of game elements (airplane, bombs, flag, clouds, and terrain), and game physics to simulate movement and acceleration.

Key Components:

  Manual Bombing:

  Players can drop bombs by pressing the b key. The bombs fall under the influence of gravity and hit the ground after a calculated time.

  Automatic Bombing:

  The a key triggers a calculation for automatic bombing, scheduling the bomb drop to align with a target based on the airplane's height, gravity, and the horizontal speed of the   flag.

  Physics Engine:

  The physics module handles calculations for vertical motion (position and acceleration) and collision detection.

  Game State Management:

  The program keeps track of the airplane’s position, bombs, flag, and clouds. It ensures smooth updates to positions, velocities, and interactions between objects.

  Rendering and Animation:

  The view module is responsible for rendering the airplane, bombs, moving clouds, and the flag. The graphics update dynamically as the game progresses.

  Dynamic Gameplay:

  The game incorporates user input (mouse movement for the airplane and keyboard keys for bomb dropping) and real-time updates to provide an interactive experience.


Architecture of the Game
  The game is organized into modular components, following an object-oriented design. Each module is responsible for specific functionality, enabling scalability, readability, and ease of debugging.

Modules and Their Responsibilities

controller.py:

Acts as the central hub for managing the game logic.
Handles user input (mouse movement, key presses for manual and automatic bombing).
Updates the game state, including the position of the airplane, bombs, clouds, and flag.
Manages the timing for automatic bomb firing and schedules bomb drops.

state.py:

Maintains the game state, including the airplane's altitude, velocity, acceleration, bombs, and the flag’s position.
Tracks past and current game variables required for calculations (e.g., time, positions).

view.py:

Responsible for rendering all visual elements of the game on the screen:
Airplane
Bombs
Clouds
Flag
Terrain
Dynamically updates the display as the game state changes.

physics.py:

Contains the physics logic for the game:
Calculates the vertical motion of bombs using formulas of acceleration and velocity.
Computes the time for automatic bomb drops to align with the flag.
Handles collision detection (bomb hitting the ground).
Provides utility functions for calculating velocities, accelerations, and distances.

constants.py:

Stores all the constants used across the game:
Gravity, flag speed, horizontal speed, window dimensions, etc.
Centralized configuration for easy modification.

main.py:

Serves as the entry point of the program.
Initializes the game by creating an instance of the Controller and starts the game loop.

How to run:
Open your termnal and type
    python main.py


Gameplay Instructions:

Use the mouse to control the altitude of the airplane.
Press b to manually drop bombs.
Press a to trigger the calculation and scheduling of automatic bomb firing based on physics and the airplane’s position.
Watch as bombs fall, hit the ground, or align with the flag in automatic mode.

Game Flow:
The game initializes with a moving airplane, clouds, and a flag.
Player actions (mouse movement and key presses) are processed by the Controller to interact with the game state.
The Physics module calculates bomb trajectories and determines collision points.
The View module continuously updates and renders the game elements for a smooth visual experience.
